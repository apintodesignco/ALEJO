# ALEJO Behavior Module

## Overview

The Behavior Module is a core component of ALEJO's personalization system that enables the assistant to learn from user interactions and adapt its responses to match the user's communication style and preferences. This module provides a sophisticated system for analyzing communication patterns, detecting implicit preferences, and adapting responses accordingly.

## Components

The Behavior Module consists of several integrated components:

### 1. Pattern Learner

The Pattern Learner analyzes user messages to identify communication style patterns across multiple dimensions:

- **Formality**: How formal or casual the user's language is
- **Verbosity**: Whether the user prefers concise or detailed responses
- **Emotionality**: The level of emotional expression in communication
- **Complexity**: The complexity of language and concepts used
- **Directness**: How direct or indirect the user's communication style is
- **Politeness**: The level of politeness in communication
- **Humor**: The user's tendency to use humor
- **Question Frequency**: How often the user asks questions

The Pattern Learner uses temporal weighting to prioritize recent patterns while maintaining a history of the user's evolving communication style.

### 2. Preference Model

The Preference Model discovers and tracks user preferences without requiring explicit input:

- Detects implicit preferences from conversation content
- Assigns confidence scores to detected preferences
- Tracks preference changes over time
- Categorizes preferences (content, interface, notifications, etc.)
- Provides contextual preference application

### 3. Adaptor

The Adaptor adjusts ALEJO's responses based on the learned communication patterns:

- Adapts formality level to match the user
- Adjusts verbosity based on user preferences
- Modifies emotional tone to align with user style
- Adjusts complexity of language and explanations
- Personalizes vocabulary based on user's frequently used words

### 4. Preference Normalization

Handles normalization of preferences across different contexts and ensures consistency in the preference model.

### 5. Preference Relationship Integration

Integrates preferences with the user's personal graph and relationship data to provide more contextually relevant personalization.

## Integration with Security

The Behavior Module is fully integrated with ALEJO's security components:

- **Audit Trail**: All pattern learning and adaptation actions are logged
- **Privacy Guard**: User data is encrypted and protected
- **Consent Management**: Personalization requires explicit user consent
- **RBAC**: Access to personalization data is controlled through role-based permissions

## Usage

### Initialization

```javascript
import * as behaviorModule from './personalization/behavior/index.js';

// Initialize with default options
await behaviorModule.initialize();

// Initialize with custom options
await behaviorModule.initialize({
  enablePreferenceNormalization: false,
  enablePreferenceRelationshipIntegration: false
});
```

### Recording User Messages

```javascript
// Record a user message for pattern learning and preference detection
await behaviorModule.recordUserMessage(userId, message, context);
```

### Adapting Responses

```javascript
// Get an adapted response based on user's communication style
const originalResponse = "Here is the information you requested.";
const adaptedResponse = await behaviorModule.adaptResponse(userId, originalResponse, context);
```

### Managing Preferences

```javascript
// Get user's preference model
const preferenceModel = await behaviorModule.getPreferenceModel(userId);

// Get a specific preference
const theme = await behaviorModule.getPreference(userId, 'interface:theme', 'light');

// Set a preference explicitly
await behaviorModule.setPreference(userId, 'interface:theme', 'dark', 'INTERFACE');
```

### Getting Style Metrics

```javascript
// Get user's communication style metrics
const styleMetrics = await behaviorModule.getStyleMetrics(userId);
console.log(styleMetrics.formality); // 0-1 scale
console.log(styleMetrics.verbosity); // 0-1 scale
```

### Resetting User Data

```javascript
// Reset all learned patterns for a user
await behaviorModule.resetPatterns(userId);
```

### Shutdown

```javascript
// Properly shutdown the behavior module
await behaviorModule.shutdown();
```

## Configuration Options

The behavior module accepts the following configuration options during initialization:

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enablePreferenceNormalization` | Boolean | `true` | Enable preference normalization |
| `enablePreferenceRelationshipIntegration` | Boolean | `true` | Enable integration with relationship data |
| `adaptationStrength` | Number | `0.7` | How strongly to adapt to user's style (0-1) |
| `temporalDecayRate` | Number | `0.99` | Rate at which older patterns decay |
| `minConfidence` | Number | `0.3` | Minimum confidence for preference application |

## Events

The behavior module emits the following events on the event bus:

| Event | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `behavior_module:initialized` | Emitted when the module is successfully initialized |
| `behavior_module:initialization_error` | Emitted when initialization fails |
| `behavior_module:shutdown_complete` | Emitted when the module is successfully shut down |
| `behavior_module:shutdown_error` | Emitted when shutdown fails |
| `pattern_learned` | Emitted when a new communication pattern is learned |
| `preference_detected` | Emitted when a new preference is detected |
| `preference_confirmed` | Emitted when a preference is confirmed |
| `style_metrics_updated` | Emitted when style metrics are updated |

## Security Considerations

1. **Data Privacy**: All user communication patterns and preferences are stored with encryption.
2. **Consent**: Users must provide explicit consent for personalization features.
3. **Data Minimization**: Only necessary data is stored, and temporal decay ensures old data is gradually removed.
4. **Transparency**: Users can view and reset their learned patterns and preferences.
5. **Audit Trail**: All personalization actions are logged for transparency and debugging.

## Best Practices

1. **Initialize Early**: Initialize the behavior module early in the application lifecycle to start learning from the first interaction.
2. **Provide Context**: When recording messages or adapting responses, provide as much context as possible for better personalization.
3. **Respect User Preferences**: Always honor explicit user preferences over learned patterns.
4. **Gradual Adaptation**: Adaptation should be subtle and gradual to avoid jarring changes in communication style.
5. **Regular Consolidation**: Periodically consolidate preferences to resolve conflicts and improve accuracy.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Inconsistent Adaptation**: If adaptation seems inconsistent, check if there's enough data for the user. The module needs multiple interactions to build an accurate model.
2. **High CPU Usage**: If the module is causing performance issues, consider reducing the frequency of preference detection or increasing the temporal window.
3. **Memory Leaks**: Ensure proper shutdown of the module when not in use to prevent memory leaks.

### Debugging

The behavior module logs detailed information to the audit trail, which can be used for debugging:

```javascript
// Get recent behavior module logs
const logs = await auditTrail.getLogs({
  module: 'behavior_module',
  limit: 50
});
```

## Future Enhancements

1. **Multi-modal Pattern Learning**: Extend pattern learning to include voice tone, facial expressions, and gestures.
2. **Cross-session Continuity**: Improve continuity of personalization across different sessions and devices.
3. **Cultural Adaptation**: Add cultural context awareness for more nuanced personalization.
4. **Group Dynamics**: Support adaptation to group conversations with multiple users.
5. **Federated Learning**: Implement privacy-preserving federated learning for improved personalization without compromising privacy.
