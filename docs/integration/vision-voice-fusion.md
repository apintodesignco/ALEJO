# Vision-Voice Fusion

## Overview

The Vision-Voice Fusion module is a critical component of ALEJO's multimodal integration system. It combines inputs from the vision and voice systems to provide a more accurate and comprehensive understanding of user intent, emotional state, and identity.

By fusing data from multiple modalities, ALEJO can:
- Detect emotional states with higher accuracy by combining facial expressions with voice tone
- Provide more secure identity verification through multimodal biometric fusion
- Enhance command understanding by adding emotional context to voice commands
- Create a more natural and responsive interaction experience

## Architecture

The Vision-Voice Fusion module sits between the personalization systems (vision and voice) and the higher-level reasoning components. It subscribes to events from both the vision and voice systems, processes the inputs within configurable temporal windows, and emits fused results.

## Key Features

### Temporal Alignment
- Inputs from different modalities are aligned within configurable time windows
- Recent inputs are buffered to allow for processing delays between modalities
- Time-synchronized fusion ensures contextual coherence

### Weighted Fusion
- Each modality contributes to the final result based on configurable weights
- Default weights favor voice for command recognition and provide balanced weighting for emotional state detection
- Confidence scores from individual modalities influence the overall confidence

### Emotional State Fusion
- Combines facial expressions with voice tone analysis
- Maps different emotional representations to a common format
- Produces a unified emotional state with confidence scores

### Identity Verification
- Enhances security through multimodal biometric verification
- Requires matching user IDs across modalities
- Provides higher confidence scores than single-modality verification

### Command Intent Enhancement
- Adds emotional context to voice commands
- Helps interpret ambiguous commands based on emotional state
- Preserves original command parameters while adding contextual information

## Usage

### Initialization

```javascript
import { visionVoiceFusion } from '../../integration/fusion/vision-voice-fusion.js';

// Initialize with default settings
await visionVoiceFusion.initialize();

// Or with custom configuration
await visionVoiceFusion.initialize({
  temporalWindow: 3000,       // 3 second window for fusion
  confidenceThreshold: 0.75,  // Higher confidence requirement
  modalityWeights: {
    voice: 0.5,
    vision: 0.5
  }
});
```

### Event Handling

The fusion module emits the following events that your application can subscribe to:

```javascript
import { eventBus } from '../../core/event-bus.js';

// Listen for fused emotional state
eventBus.on('fused_emotional_state', (data) => {
  console.log(`User's emotional state: ${data.dominant} (${data.confidence.toFixed(2)})`);
});

// Listen for fused identity verification
eventBus.on('fused_identity_verification', (data) => {
  if (data.isVerified) {
    console.log(`User ${data.userId} verified with ${data.confidence.toFixed(2)} confidence`);
  }
});

// Listen for enhanced commands
eventBus.on('fused_command_intent', (data) => {
  console.log(`Command: ${data.command} with emotional context: ${data.emotionalContext}`);
});
```

## Security and Privacy

The Vision-Voice Fusion module integrates with ALEJO's security framework:

- **Consent Management**: Requires explicit user consent for multimodal fusion
- **Audit Trail**: All fusion operations are logged for transparency
- **Local Processing**: All fusion happens locally by default, with no data sent to external servers
- **Minimal Data Retention**: Input buffers are limited in size and automatically pruned

## Configuration Options

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| `temporalWindow` | Time window (ms) for considering inputs as simultaneous | 2000 |
| `confidenceThreshold` | Minimum confidence for inputs to be considered | 0.65 |
| `modalityWeights.voice` | Weight given to voice inputs in fusion | 0.6 |
| `modalityWeights.vision` | Weight given to vision inputs in fusion | 0.4 |
| `bufferSize` | Maximum number of inputs to keep in buffer per modality | 10 |

## Integration with Other Components

### Vision System
- Subscribes to `expression_detected`, `face_detected`, and `face_verification_completed` events
- Requires the vision system to be initialized and running

### Voice System
- Subscribes to `voice_emotion_detected`, `voice_command_detected`, and `voice_verification_completed` events
- Requires the voice system to be initialized and running

### Multimodal Merge
- Complements the broader multimodal merge system
- Focuses specifically on vision-voice integration while multimodal merge handles all input types

## Future Enhancements

- **Gesture Integration**: Adding gesture recognition for even richer multimodal understanding
- **Contextual Memory**: Incorporating historical interaction patterns for better fusion
- **Adaptive Weighting**: Dynamically adjusting modality weights based on environmental conditions
- **Conflict Resolution**: Enhanced strategies for resolving contradictory inputs between modalities

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No fusion events emitted**
   - Ensure both vision and voice systems are initialized
   - Check that required consent has been granted
   - Verify that both modalities are producing events

2. **Low confidence in fused results**
   - Check individual modality confidence scores
   - Adjust confidence threshold if necessary
   - Ensure proper lighting for vision and audio quality for voice

3. **Misaligned fusion results**
   - Increase the temporal window if modalities have significant processing delays
   - Check system performance if event processing is delayed

### Debugging

Enable debug logging to see detailed fusion operations:

```javascript
await visionVoiceFusion.initialize({ debug: true });
```
