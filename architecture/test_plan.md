- Require all tests to pass before merge
- Run security scans on code changes

3. **Performance Monitoring**

- Monitor resource usage
- Alert on performance regressions

## 4. Test Automation

### 4.1 Unit Test Automation

```python

# Example unit test for encryption module

def test_encrypt_decrypt_text():
    encryption = AlejoEncryption("test_key")
    original_text = "This is a test message"
    encrypted = encryption.encrypt_text(original_text)

    # Verify encrypted text is different from original
    assert encrypted != original_text.encode()

    # Verify decryption returns original text
    decrypted = encryption.decrypt_text(encrypted)
    assert decrypted == original_text
```text

### 4.2 Integration Test Automation

```python

# Example integration test for security and vision modules

def test_secure_camera_integration():
    # Initialize security manager with test configuration
    security_manager = SecurityManager({
        "security_level": "high",
        "encryption_key": "test_key"
    })

    # Initialize secure camera with security manager
    secure_camera = SecureCameraIntegration({
        "camera_id": 0,
        "storage_path": str(tmp_path)
    }, security_manager)

    # Test secure screenshot capture
    filename = "test_screenshot.png"
    secure_camera.capture_secure_screenshot(filename)

    # Verify file exists and is encrypted
    encrypted_path = tmp_path / f"{filename}.enc"
    assert encrypted_path.exists()

    # Verify decryption works
    decrypted_path = secure_camera.retrieve_screenshot(filename)
    assert decrypted_path.exists()
```text

### 4.3 System Test Automation

```python

# Example system test for browser compatibility workflow

def test_browser_compatibility_workflow():
    # Initialize ALEJO with test configuration
    alejo = ALEJO({
        "security_level": "medium",
        "test_mode": True
    })

    # Run browser detection
    browsers = alejo.detect_browsers()
    assert len(browsers) > 0

    # Run compatibility test on test website
    results = alejo.run_compatibility_test("<https://example.com>")

    # Verify results structure
    assert "compatibility_score" in results
    assert "browser_results" in results
    assert len(results["browser_results"]) == len(browsers)

    # Verify report generation
    report_path = alejo.generate_report(results)
    assert report_path.exists()
