# ALEJO System Optimization Priorities

## Prioritization Framework

This document outlines the prioritization framework for optimizing the ALEJO system across multiple dimensions. Each optimization item is evaluated based on three criteria:

1. **Impact (I)** - How much value it brings to the system (scale: 1-5)
2. **Complexity (C)** - How difficult it is to implement (scale: 1-5)
3. **Urgency (U)** - How soon it needs to be addressed (scale: 1-5)

The overall priority score is calculated using the formula:

```python
Priority Score = (Impact * 0.5) + (Urgency * 0.3) + ((6 - Complexity) * 0.2)
```text


Higher scores indicate higher priority. This framework helps us focus on high-impact, urgent items that are relatively less complex to implement first.

## Optimization Items by Priority

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Critical Fixes (1-2 Weeks)

- Fix critical security vulnerabilities
- Integrate code quality tools in CI pipeline
- Replace remaining broad exception handlers
- Implement secure configuration management
- Fix memory leaks

### Phase 2: High-Impact Improvements (2-4 Weeks)

- Add comprehensive input validation
- Increase test coverage for critical components
- Implement asynchronous processing for blocking operations
- Ensure cross-browser compatibility for gesture system
- Begin implementing horizontal scaling

### Phase 3: System Enhancements (4-8 Weeks)

- Generate API documentation
- Add circuit breakers for external dependencies
- Implement caching strategy
- Address high-priority TODO comments
- Add API gateway capabilities

### Phase 4: Long-Term Optimization (8+ Weeks)

- Implement comprehensive code profiling
- Create detailed deployment guides
- Begin microservices refactoring
- Add gesture system user customization
- Improve user onboarding experience

## Monitoring & Adjustment

This prioritization framework is not static. We will:

1. Review and update priorities weekly
2. Adjust based on new findings from testing
3. Re-evaluate after each phase completion
4. Consider user feedback for priority adjustments

## Next Steps

1. Begin implementing Tier 1 items immediately
2. Set up tracking system for optimization progress
3. Schedule weekly priority review meetings
4. Establish metrics to measure optimization impact
