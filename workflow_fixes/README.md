# Workflow Fix Plan

This directory contains fixed versions of GitHub workflow files to address all failures and deprecated actions.

## Issues Identified

1. Deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v1` 
2. Potential other deprecated actions
3. Configuration inconsistencies

## Fix Strategy

1. Update all actions to latest versions
2. Standardize workflow configurations
3. Create single comprehensive test workflow initially
4. Re-enable other workflows incrementally after testing
