# ALEJO Integration & Security Layer

This directory contains the security components of the ALEJO Integration & Security Layer, which provides robust privacy controls, consent management, ethical boundaries, and audit logging for the ALEJO system.

## Architecture

The security layer consists of the following key components:

### Core Security Components

1. **Privacy Guard** (`privacy_guard.js`)
   - Manages data privacy through filtering, anonymization, and encryption
   - Classifies data into sensitivity levels and categories
   - Enforces privacy controls based on user preferences and consent

2. **Consent Enforcer** (`consent_enforcer.js`)
   - Manages user consent across multiple data categories
   - Supports consent granting, withdrawal, and expiration
   - Provides strict and non-strict consent checking modes

3. **Audit Trail** (`audit_trail.js`)
   - Logs security-relevant operations for transparency and compliance
   - Supports filtering, anonymization, and retention policies
   - Provides query capabilities for security analysis

4. **Boundary Enforcer** (`../ethics/boundary_enforcer.js`)
   - Prevents harmful behavior by enforcing ethical boundaries
   - Supports multiple enforcement levels (block, warn, monitor, inform)
   - Configurable by category (safety, legal, privacy, ethics, etc.)

5. **Security Manager** (`index.js`)
   - Provides a unified interface to all security components
   - Simplifies integration with other ALEJO modules
   - Coordinates security checks across components

## Integration Points

The security layer integrates with other ALEJO components through the following mechanisms:

1. **Event-Driven Architecture**
   - Components emit events that other modules can listen for
   - Supports asynchronous, reactive updates

2. **Direct API Calls**
   - Components expose methods that can be called directly
   - Security manager provides a simplified interface

3. **Middleware Pattern**
   - Security checks can be inserted into processing pipelines
   - Filters sensitive data before it reaches other components

## Usage Examples

### Basic Security Check

```javascript
import { securityManager } from '../integration/security/index.js';

// Initialize security components
await securityManager.initialize();

// Check if content respects security boundaries
const content = userInput;
const securityCheck = securityManager.checkSecurityBoundaries(content);

if (securityCheck.allowed) {
  // Process content normally
  processUserInput(content);
} else {
  // Handle security violation
  handleSecurityViolation(securityCheck.boundaries);
}
```

### Privacy Filtering

```javascript
import { securityManager } from '../integration/security/index.js';

// Filter sensitive data
const userData = {
  name: 'John Doe',
  email: 'john.doe@example.com',
  ssn: '123-45-6789'
};

const filteredData = securityManager.filterSensitiveData('user_profile', userData);
// filteredData will have sensitive fields like SSN redacted or anonymized
```

### Consent Management

```javascript
import { consentEnforcer, CONSENT_CATEGORIES } from '../integration/security/index.js';

// Check if user has granted consent for personalization
const hasConsent = consentEnforcer.checkConsent(CONSENT_CATEGORIES.PERSONALIZATION);

if (hasConsent) {
  // Perform personalization
  personalizeContent();
} else {
  // Show generic content
  showGenericContent();
}

// Update consent status
consentEnforcer.updateConsent(
  CONSENT_CATEGORIES.PERSONALIZATION, 
  'granted',
  { expirationDays: 365 }
);
```

### Audit Logging

```javascript
import { auditTrail, AUDIT_EVENT_TYPES, AUDIT_SEVERITY } from '../integration/security/index.js';

// Log a security event
auditTrail.logEvent(AUDIT_EVENT_TYPES.SECURITY, {
  action: 'user_authentication',
  severity: AUDIT_SEVERITY.INFO,
  userId: '12345',
  success: true
});

// Get audit entries for analysis
const securityEvents = auditTrail.getAuditEntries({
  type: AUDIT_EVENT_TYPES.SECURITY,
  fromDate: '2023-01-01T00:00:00Z'
});
```

## Configuration

Each component can be configured independently through its `updateConfiguration` method:

```javascript
import { privacyGuard, SENSITIVITY_LEVELS } from '../integration/security/index.js';

// Configure privacy guard
privacyGuard.updateConfiguration({
  strictMode: true,
  defaultSensitivityLevel: SENSITIVITY_LEVELS.HIGH,
  enableAnonymization: true
});
```

Alternatively, all components can be configured through the security manager:

```javascript
import { securityManager } from '../integration/security/index.js';

// Initialize with configuration
await securityManager.initialize({
  audit: { enabled: true, logToConsole: false },
  consent: { strictMode: true, defaultExpirationDays: 365 },
  privacy: { strictMode: true, defaultSensitivityLevel: 'high' },
  boundaries: { strictMode: true }
});
```

## Testing

Comprehensive unit and integration tests are available in the `tests` directory:

- `test_security_layer.js`: Unit tests for individual security components
- `test_security_integration.js`: Integration tests for security components working together

Run tests using the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Default Settings

By default, the security layer is configured with strict privacy and consent settings:

- Privacy filtering is enabled for all sensitive data categories
- Explicit consent is required for all consent categories
- Audit logging is enabled for all security-relevant operations
- Ethical boundaries are enforced for safety, legal, and privacy categories

These settings can be adjusted based on deployment requirements, but the default configuration prioritizes user privacy and security.

## Future Enhancements

Planned enhancements for the security layer include:

1. Enhanced anonymization techniques using differential privacy
2. Integration with external consent management platforms
3. Machine learning-based privacy risk assessment
4. Expanded boundary enforcement for emerging ethical concerns
5. Compliance reporting for various regulatory frameworks
