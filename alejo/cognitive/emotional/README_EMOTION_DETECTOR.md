# ALEJO Emotion Detection System

## Overview

The ALEJO Emotion Detection System is a comprehensive, production-ready multimodal emotion detection framework that integrates text, voice, and facial emotion analysis. It provides robust, context-aware emotion detection capabilities to enhance ALEJO's cognitive core with emotional intelligence.

## Key Features

- **Multimodal Analysis**: Detects emotions from text, voice, and facial expressions
- **Fusion Engine**: Combines signals from multiple modalities for more accurate detection
- **Contextual Awareness**: Tracks emotional context over time and sessions
- **Event Integration**: Publishes emotion detection events to ALEJO's event bus
- **Relationship Memory**: Records emotional patterns in ALEJO's long-term memory
- **Trend Analysis**: Provides insights into emotional trends and stability
- **Asynchronous API**: Non-blocking design for scalable performance
- **Error Handling**: Robust error handling with decorators
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration tests for all components

## Architecture

The emotion detection system consists of the following components:

1. **Core Detector** (`emotion_detector.py`): Central orchestrator that manages detection from different modalities
2. **Analyzers**:
   - `text_analyzer.py`: Analyzes text input for emotional content
   - `voice_analyzer.py`: Extracts emotional signals from voice features
   - `facial_analyzer.py`: Detects emotions from facial expressions
3. **Type System** (`emotion_types.py`): Defines emotion categories, scores, and results
4. **Integration Components**:
   - Event bus integration for publishing emotion events
   - Relationship memory integration for long-term emotional context
   - Multimodal fusion engine for combining signals

## Usage Examples

### Basic Text Emotion Detection

```python
from alejo.cognitive.emotional.emotion_detector import EmotionDetector

# Initialize detector

detector = EmotionDetector()

# Detect emotions from text

result = await detector.detect_from_text(
    text="I'm really excited about this new project!",
    session_id="user_session_123"
)

print(f"Detected emotion: {result.primary.category.value}")
print(f"Intensity: {result.primary.intensity:.2f}")
print(f"Confidence: {result.primary.confidence:.2f}")
```text

### Multimodal Emotion Detection

```python

# Detect emotions from multiple modalities

result = await detector.detect_multimodal(
    text="I'm really excited about this new project!",
    voice_features={
        "pitch_mean": 220.0,
        "pitch_range": 80.0,
        "intensity_mean": 75.0,
        "speech_rate": 6.0,
        "voice_quality": "bright"
    },
    facial_features={
        "smile_intensity": 0.8,
        "eye_openness": 0.7,
        "brow_position": 0.6
    },
    session_id="user_session_123",
    user_id="user_456"
)
```text

### Analyzing Emotional Trends

```python

# Get emotion trend for a session

trend = detector.get_emotion_trend(
    session_id="user_session_123",
    window=10  # Consider last 10 detections
)

print(f"Trend: {trend['trend']}")
print(f"Dominant emotion: {trend['dominant_emotion']}")
print(f"Intensity change: {trend['intensity_change']:.2f}")
```text

### Retrieving Emotional Context from Memory

```python

# Get emotional context from relationship memory

context = await detector.get_emotional_context_from_memory(
    user_id="user_456",
    lookback_days=7
)

print(f"Dominant emotion: {context['dominant_emotion']}")
print(f"Emotional stability: {context['emotional_stability']}")
print(f"Average sentiment: {context['average_sentiment']:.2f}")
```text

## Integration with ALEJO Core Systems

### Event Bus Integration

The emotion detector publishes events to ALEJO's event bus when emotions are detected:

```python

# Subscribe to emotion events

await event_bus.subscribe("emotion_detected", on_emotion_detected)

async def on_emotion_detected(event):
    print(f"Detected {event.data['primary_emotion']} with intensity {event.data['primary_intensity']}")
```text

### Relationship Memory Integration

The detector updates ALEJO's relationship memory with emotional context:

```python

# Initialize detector with relationship memory

detector = EmotionDetector(
    relationship_memory=RelationshipMemory()
)

# Emotion detection will automatically update relationship memory

await detector.detect_from_text(
    text="I'm feeling great today!",
    user_id="user_456"
)
```text

## Performance Considerations

- The emotion detector uses asynchronous methods for non-blocking operation
- History size is limited to control memory usage (20 items per context, 100 per session)
- Confidence scores are used to weight multimodal fusion for optimal accuracy
- Event publishing and memory updates are skipped if respective components are not available

## Testing

The system includes comprehensive test coverage:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components and methods
- **Integration Tests**: Test interaction with ALEJO's core systems
- **End-to-End Tests**: Test complete emotion detection flows

Run tests with:

```bash

# Run unit tests

python -m unittest tests.cognitive.emotional.test_emotion_detector

# Run integration tests

python -m unittest tests.integration.test_emotion_detector_integration
```text

## Future Enhancements

1. **Enhanced Multimodal Fusion**: Implement more sophisticated fusion algorithms using weighted attention mechanisms
2. **Temporal Context**: Consider temporal patterns and sequences in emotion detection
3. **Personalization**: Adapt to individual users' emotional expression patterns
4. **Cultural Awareness**: Account for cultural differences in emotion expression
5. **Privacy Controls**: Add granular privacy controls for emotion data
