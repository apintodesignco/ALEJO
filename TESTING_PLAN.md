# ALEJO Comprehensive Testing & Optimization Plan

This document outlines the strategy for rigorously testing and optimizing the ALEJO application to ensure it is robust, performant, and ready for production use.

## 1. Functional Testing

Objective: Verify that all features work correctly under various conditions and that all modules integrate seamlessly.

### 1.1. Vision Module

- **Gaze Tracking:**
  - [ ] **Blink Detection:** Confirm consistent detection across different users and lighting.
  - [ ] **Gaze-to-Screen Mapping:** Test accuracy and calibration process. Does gaze accurately target UI elements?
  - [ ] **Gaze-based Control:** Verify that gaze can be used to trigger UI events (e.g., clicks, scrolls) reliably.
  - [ ] **Environmental Robustness:** Test with glasses, in low-light/bright-light conditions, and with varying head poses.
- **Emotion Detection:**
  - [ ] **Accuracy:** Test against a labeled dataset of facial expressions to measure accuracy.
  - [ ] **Real-time Performance:** Ensure emotion detection does not introduce significant latency.

### 1.2. Voice & Command Module

- **Speech-to-Text (STT):**
  - [ ] **Accuracy:** Test with different voices, accents, and levels of background noise.
  - [ ] **Latency:** Measure the delay between speaking and the transcribed text appearing.
- **Command Processing:**
  - [ ] **Command Scope:** Test the full range of documented commands (e.g., file operations, web searches).
  - [ ] **Ambiguity Handling:** How does the system respond to unclear or ambiguous commands?
  - [ ] **Natural Language Understanding:** Test complex, multi-part, or conversational commands.

### 1.3. Brain & Emotional Intelligence

- **LLM Interaction:**
  - [ ] **Context Retention:** Verify that the system maintains context across multiple turns in a conversation.
  - [ ] **Response Quality:** Evaluate responses for relevance, coherence, and accuracy.
- **Ethical Framework:**
  - [ ] **Constraint Adherence:** Test scenarios that should trigger ethical guardrails. Does the system refuse inappropriate requests?
  - [ ] **Value Alignment:** Ensure responses are consistent with the defined ethical principles.

## 2. Performance & Stress Testing

Objective: Identify and eliminate bottlenecks, measure resource usage, and ensure the system remains stable under heavy load.

- **Resource Profiling:**
  - [ ] Measure baseline CPU, GPU, and RAM usage.
  - [ ] Identify resource spikes during specific operations (e.g., vision processing, LLM inference).
- **Latency Measurement:**
  - [ ] End-to-end latency for voice commands.
  - [ ] End-to-end latency for gaze commands.
- **Stress Testing (using a tool like `locust`):**
  - [ ] Simulate high-frequency event bus traffic.
  - [ ] Test concurrent access to services (if migrated to a microservices architecture).
- **Model Optimization:**
  - [ ] Verify models are using available hardware acceleration (GPU/CUDA).
  - [ ] Investigate model quantization or conversion to ONNX/TensorRT for performance gains.

## 3. Robustness & Error Handling

Objective: Ensure the application handles failures and unexpected conditions gracefully.

- **Edge Case Testing:**
  - [ ] **Hardware Failures:** Simulate webcam/microphone disconnection.
  - [ ] **Network Failures:** Simulate loss of internet connectivity or Redis connection.
- **Invalid Input Handling:**
  - [ ] Test malformed configuration files.
  - [ ] Test corrupted input data to vision/audio streams.
- **Logging & Monitoring:**
  - [ ] Review logs to ensure they are clear, structured, and provide actionable diagnostic information.
  - [ ] Plan for integration with a production monitoring tool (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).

## 4. Security

Objective: Identify and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities.

- **Dependency Scan:**
  - [ ] Regularly run `snyk` or similar tools to check for vulnerabilities in third-party packages.
- **Input Sanitization:**
  - [ ] Ensure any user input used in commands (e.g., file paths, URLs) is properly sanitized to prevent injection attacks.
- **API Security (for microservices):**
  - [ ] Implement authentication and authorization for service-to-service communication.

## 5. Architecture

Objective: Evaluate and refine the system architecture for scalability and maintainability.

- **Microservices Migration:**
  - [ ] Re-evaluate the microservices prototype (`services` directory).
  - [ ] Develop a plan to fully migrate from a monolithic to a microservices architecture.
