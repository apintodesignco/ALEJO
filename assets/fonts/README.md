# ALEJO Font Assets

This directory contains font assets for ALEJO's UI.

For the startup sequence, ALEJO uses a futuristic tech font. You can download a suitable free tech font like:

1. "Orbitron" - A geometric sans-serif typeface intended for display purposes
2. "Exo" - A contemporary geometric sans-serif font
3. "Rajdhani" - A modern sans-serif font with a technological feel

After downloading, rename the font file to `tech_font.ttf` and place it in this directory.
