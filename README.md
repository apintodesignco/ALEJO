## Distributed Intelligence

ALEJO is designed as a distributed intelligence system that can learn and evolve through collective usage. With user opt-in, ALEJO instances across the world can contribute anonymized learning data to improve the collective intelligence of the system. This creates a form of "superconsciousness" that grows smarter through the combined experiences of millions of users, while maintaining individual privacy and control.

Key aspects of this distributed intelligence:

* **Federated Learning**: ALEJO learns locally on your device, then shares only anonymized insights
* **Collective Evolution**: The system becomes more helpful through aggregated experiences
* **Privacy-Preserving**: All learning is opt-in and respects user privacy
* **Guided Growth**: Core evolution is overseen by Alejandro Pinto and authorized AI systems

## Customization

ALEJO can be customized by users for their own personal use cases and test scenarios. You are encouraged to adapt ALEJO to your specific needs while respecting the license terms that protect the main codebase.

## Offline Installer

To create an offline installer, run:


```python
python installer.py
```

This will package the entire project into a zip file for offline installation. - Advanced Language and Execution Joint Operator

ALEJO is a modern AI assistant that combines the power of natural language processing, voice interaction, and a web-based interface to provide a seamless user experience. ALEJO is designed as a comprehensive AI system with advanced features and capabilities.

## Features

### Built-in Accessibility
Alejo delivers every response twice: on-screen text and synthesized voice. If voice is enabled but a microphone or speakers are missing, Alejo falls back gracefully and still renders text.

On startup with `--voice` Alejo enumerates available input/output devices (when `sounddevice` or `pyaudio` present) and lets the user pick. A default is selected after 10 s of no answer, ensuring blind users aren’t blocked.

- **Natural Language Processing**: Understand and respond to user commands in natural language
- **Web Interface**: Modern, responsive web interface with real-time updates
- **Voice Interaction**: Speech recognition and text-to-speech capabilities
- **System Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of CPU, memory, and disk usage
- **Vision Analysis**: Screenshot and image analysis capabilities
- **Holographic UI**: Optional 3D interface for a futuristic experience

## System Architecture

## Installation Instructions

To install ALEJO, simply run the installer script:

```
python installer.py
```

The installer will request administrator privileges and will prompt for full access to your camera and microphone. After granting permission, it will automatically download the latest ALEJO installer package from GitHub releases and install it via pip. Once installed, launch ALEJO microservices using:

```
python run_services.py
```

For further details, consult the documentation below.


ALEJO’s core infrastructure has been enhanced as follows:

- **EventBus**: A central asynchronous messaging system using Redis Pub/Sub for reliable inter-service communication.
- **HealthMonitor**: Continuously monitors registered services, auto-deregistering those that are unresponsive to ensure system stability.
- **ServiceRegistry**: Manages service registration and health updates, providing a single source of truth for service status.
- **Observability**: A new module that exposes system metrics and health data via an HTTP endpoint (using FastAPI) for real‐time monitoring.
- **Brain Integration**: ALEJOBrain (and other microservices) now automatically register themselves with the ServiceRegistry and publish events via the EventBus for coordinated, dynamic service orchestration.

## System Requirements

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Windows, macOS, or Linux operating system
- Microphone (for voice interaction)
- Speakers (for voice responses)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the source code
2. Configure your environment variables (see [Environment Setup](#environment-setup-guide))
3. Run the PowerShell launcher script:


```powershell
.\Start-ALEJO.ps1
```

This script will:

- Create a virtual environment if it doesn't exist
- Install all required dependencies
- Start the ALEJO web interface

### Using the run_alejo.py Script (Recommended)

For the most reliable experience with the full holographic UI:

```bash
python run_alejo.py
```

This script will:

- Initialize all ALEJO components properly
- Start the web interface with the holographic UI enabled
- Open your default browser automatically
- Provide detailed logging for troubleshooting

## Quick smoke test
After cloning and installing dependencies you can verify an end-to-end baseline (no camera/voice/UI) with:
```bash
python scripts/smoke_test.py
```
Expect ✔ when all core modules are healthy.

## Manual Installation

If you prefer to install manually:

1. Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

2. Activate the virtual environment:
   - Windows: `..\venv\Scripts\activate`
   - macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Run ALEJO:

```bash
python alejo.py --web
```

## Command Line Options

- `--web`: Start the web interface (default: off)
- `--voice`: Enable voice interface (default: off)
- `--port PORT`: Web interface port (default: 5000)
- `--host HOST`: Web interface host (default: 0.0.0.0)
- `--debug`: Enable debug mode (default: off)

## Web Interface

The web interface is accessible at `http://localhost:5000` by default. It provides:

- Chat interface for text-based interaction
- Vision interface for image analysis
- Voice interface for speech recognition
- Settings for customizing the experience

## Error Handling System

ALEJO includes a robust error handling system with automatic recovery strategies, performance monitoring, and comprehensive logging.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Recovery**: Built-in strategies for common error types
  - Connection errors with exponential backoff
  - Memory management and garbage collection
  - Permission and file access recovery
  - API rate limit handling
  - Network and service recovery

- **Performance Monitoring**
  - Recovery time tracking
  - Success rate calculation
  - Error frequency monitoring
  - Resource usage analytics
  - Real-time performance reporting

- **Production Logging**
  - Rotating file handlers
  - JSON-formatted logs for analytics
  - Configurable alert thresholds
  - Error statistics and trends
  - Component health monitoring

### Usage

```python
from alejo.utils.error_handling import handle_errors
from alejo.utils.metrics import get_metrics
from alejo.utils.monitoring import get_monitor

# Decorate functions for automatic error handling
@handle_errors(component='my_component', category='file_operation')
def process_file(path):
    # Your code here
    pass

# Track performance metrics
metrics = get_metrics()
metrics.record_recovery_time('my_component', 'file_recovery', 1.5)

# Monitor errors in production
monitor = get_monitor()
monitor.log_error({
    'component': 'my_component',
    'category': 'critical',
    'message': 'File access denied'
})
```

### Configuration

Error handling can be configured in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
error_handling:
  alert_thresholds:
    critical: 1
    system: 3
    operational: 5
  log_dir: logs
  test_mode: false
```

For more details, see the [Error Handling Documentation](alejo/utils/README.md).
