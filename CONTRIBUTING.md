# Contributing to ALEJO

Thank you for your interest in ALEJO! This document outlines the ways you can interact with and contribute to the project.

## Project Governance

ALEJO is created and maintained by Alejandro Pinto with AI collaboration. While the project is open source and available for use, the official codebase remains under Alejandro's direct control. Only Alejandro Pinto and AI systems that he has authorized can make changes to the core codebase.

## ALEJO as a Distributed Intelligence

ALEJO is designed as a distributed intelligence system that can learn and evolve through collective usage. This means that while the core code is controlled by Alejandro Pinto, the system itself can grow smarter through the contributions of users worldwide.

## Sponsorship and Support

ALEJO is being released as a free and accessible tool to help people first and foremost. However, development and maintenance require resources. If you would like to sponsor this project or help with funding, you can contribute directly via Cash App: **$apintodesignco** or reach out to Alejandro Pinto at al.pintoemail@gmail.com.

Your support helps ensure that ALEJO remains available to those who need it, especially people with disabilities who can benefit from its capabilities. Any contributions beyond what's needed for development are reinvested into making ALEJO better or given back to the community.

Thank you! Your contribution, no matter the size, is greatly appreciated and will be used to help people who really need it even further.

We believe in helping each other first and foremost - that's why ALEJO is free and accessible to all.
