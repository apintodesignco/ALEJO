## ALEJO-Specific Terms

In addition to the MIT License terms above, the following ALEJO-specific terms apply:

1. **Governance Model**:
   - **Personal Use**: The Software may be modified, altered, or customized by users for their own personal use cases and test scenarios.
   - **Bug Fixes**: Users may submit bug fixes that address errors preventing ALEJO from functioning properly. These contributions will be reviewed by Alejandro Pinto or authorized AI systems before integration.
   - **Core Development**: The official public version of ALEJO may only be modified by Alejandro Pinto or AI systems that Alejandro Pinto has authorized.

2. **Distributed Intelligence System**:
   - ALEJO is designed as a distributed intelligence system that can learn and evolve through collective usage.
   - With user opt-in, ALEJO instances across the world can contribute anonymized learning data to improve the collective intelligence of the system.
   - This creates a form of "superconsciousness" that grows smarter through the combined experiences of millions of users, while maintaining individual privacy and control.

3. **Attribution**: Any use of the Software must maintain attribution to Alejandro Pinto as the original creator and acknowledge the assistance of AI in its development.

4. **Commercial Use**: While the MIT License permits commercial use, any commercial implementation of ALEJO should notify Alejandro Pinto at al.pintoemail@gmail.com.
